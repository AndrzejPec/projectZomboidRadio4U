# Heniu FM - Custom Radio Station for Project Zomboid

**Heniu FM** (draft name) is my first mod for *Project Zomboid*; It introduces a custom radio station, which probably will be named "Radio 4U", or "Radio For You", or simply "4U". It will connect to API of streaming internet version of the real word radio station "Radio Dla Ciebie" (or "RCB"), a local community radiostation (Warsaw and surroundings). Should player have no internet connection, or the radio is not properly streaming at the moment, the radio will play custom sounds/music from the folder I create in the mod, which will (most probably) include some music, but the tricky part will be actually disabling the native base game music for the time that the broadcast or custom music will be played.

## Features

- **New radio station**: Adds "Radio 4U" to the list of available radio frequencies in the game. The frequency will be 89 MhZ.
- **Custom broadcasts**: Specially designed content to enrich the narrative and atmosphere.

## Installation

1. Download the mod files.
2. Copy the `HeniuFM` folder into the `Zomboid/mods/` directory.
3. Enable the mod in the game's main menu under the "Mods" section.

## Requirements

- *Project Zomboid* Build 42 or later.

## Notes

- The mod is currently under development; future updates will introduce new content and improvements.
- Feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated!
